A local quiz or flashcard thing I have decided to make to become more familiar with C and github. I would like to add a GUI eventually but that is still a ways away. As of June 8th 12:08 the project is done while it lacks a GUI amd will probably encounter an error the second you use a random db that isn't created with this program, it is still done. So, for the time being it will be left as is while I start other projects and once I have the energy I will come back and finish this.
